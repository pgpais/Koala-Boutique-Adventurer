# Ye Olde Shop - Adventurer Version

[Check out the Manager version](https://github.com/pgpais/Ye-Olde-Shop--Parent-), the other part of this game.

### Implemented features:

#### Map generation

The game generates a map with several rooms. These rooms have no random generation elements in themselves (yet).

#### Rooms

- Trap and/or Enemy
- Buffs
- Healing
- Loot
- Secret
- Exit

#### Enemies

- Chaser
- Turret (Missing sprites)

#### Traps

- Spike trap
- Arrow trap (Missing sprites)

### Gatherables

Some objects can be interacted with in order to receive another type of item. (right now, the only example of this are the mushrooms)

#### Weapons

- Mace (Slow but heavy hits)
- Sword (Fast but less damage)
- Bow (Ranged)

#### Classes

- Warrior (uses mace, has more health and is slower)
- Rogue (uses sword, less health but faster)
- Ranger (uses bow, slightly faster than warrior)

#### UI

- Player Health (and icon)
- Lantern time left
- Map UI showing explored rooms
- Picked up item UI feedback
- Mission End Screen (first draft)

### Gameplay:

The player goes on missions to provide the Manager (other game) with resources to unlock more classes/items/buffs. These new mechanics and the prospect of unlocking more incentivize the player into coming back.
